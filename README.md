Mine and Blade : Battlegear - 2
===============================

Source is updated for Minecraft 1.5

This is the second iteration of Mine & Blade: Battlegear, the popular dual-wielding and combat mod for Minecraft.
The mod will have a heavy dependency on the use of ASM (coremod) to edit the bytecode of the minecraft base classess. Currently this feature is not avaliable.

What does and doesn't work
--------------------------
**What works**
* Dual wielding of weapons and fists
* Switching between normal and battlemode with the 'R' Key
* Attacking entities with both the offhand and mainhand weapons
* Rendering of dual wielding in 1st person view
* 3rd person renderering
* Initial work on the equip screen
* Inital work on an API to allow other modders to define dual wielding weapons
* Swinging of offhand items of other players
* Rendering of offhand weapons on other players
* Basic Shift Clicking on the inventory screen
* Initial Configuration Files
* Basic Heraldry

**Note from nerd-boy:** I am not 100% happy with the way we are syncing items. It works now by sending a packet with all the "battle items" to each player that is viewing a player every 5 ticks. I am not sure if this will be too much or not. Although right now I cannot think of another way to do it that doesn't require more bytecode manipulation. I think we already have enough AccessTransformers planed to keep us busy without adding more that we may in fact not need.

**What does not work**
* (Most) ASM capabilities*
* Rendering of sheathed weapons
**ASM Transformers**
* EntityPlayer (sk) - (12/12 edits)
* ModelBiped -(2/2 edits)
* NetClientHandeler - (2/2 edits)
* PlayerControlerMP - (2/2 edits)
* EntityOtherPlayerMP - (0/2 edits)
* ItemRenderer - (3/3 edits)
* RenderPlayer - (0/3 edits)
* Minecraft - (0/1 edits)
* EntityAIControledByPlayer - (0/1 edits)
* ItemInWorldManager - (0/1 edits)
* NetServiceHandeler - (3/3 edits)


Instalation
-----------
The files contained within the repository must be placed inside a minecraft forge-universal src installation.
Due to potential legal issues of re-distributing Majong .java files, all base class edits are distributed as .java.patch files.

The full battlegear source can be obtained by running

``./battlegear-install.sh``
on a unix enviroment or
``./battlegear-install.cmd``
on a windows environment

The patch source can be re-obtained by issuing

`` ./battlegear-getsrc.sh``
on a unix enviroment or
``./battlegear-getsrc.cmd``
on a windows environment

Remember to set the exeuction bit to true on the unix enviroment

When the project is in a more mature state I will also include another script (likely an ant script) to retrieve the fully compiled and packaged code



Some Notes for Texture Pack Makers
----------------------------------

Some of the item names will change, sorry they currently have not been finalised.

Some of the rendering capabilities of the mod are a little different, especially concerning the heraldry. The following are a few notes.
* The patterns should only have white. The white section will determine the secondary colour. The primary colour will be the alpha section. Semi transparent sections should also work for better blending.
* The icons should be greyscale and alpha values. They also require at least 1 pixal border around the whole image that should be kept black. This is the reason all of them are 18x18 pixals (16x16 plus a 1px border all around)
